## About <a name = "about"></a>

Overview:
I built this website as a playground to try new techniques I learn and showcase my favorite work while conveying my tastes and personality.

Tools used:
This was my first go at implementing HTML5 and CSS. I've experimented with tables, flexbox and grid layouts, and design principles, to name a few.

Future plans:
This project in particular is ever growing. In order of priority, I intend to:
1. Optimize accessibility to meet <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Lighthouse</a> standards
2. Add light, dark, and contrast modes for greater accessibility and customization
3. Make <a href="about.html">about</a> section more interactive, adding links to relevant content
4. Add more projects!
