## About <a name = "about"></a>

Overview:
I built this website as a playground to try new techniques I learn and showcase my favorite work while conveying my tastes and personality.

Tools used:
This was my first go at implementing HTML5 and CSS. I've experimented with tables, flexbox and grid layouts, and design principles, to name a few.

Future plans:
This project in particular is ever growing. In order of priority, I intend to:
1. Ensure the site is responsive and accessible
2. Add a border to all pages, improve buttons, and clean up code
3. Add icons to navbar
4. Make about section more interactive, adding links to relevant content
5. Add additional color scheme options for optimal accessibility and customized experience
